---

`@theholocron/semantic-release-config` provides `defineConfig` — a factory that produces a complete semantic-release configuration for any theholocron project.

## Install

```bash
npm i -D @theholocron/semantic-release-config semantic-release
```

## Usage

In `release.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@theholocron/semantic-release-config";

export default defineConfig({
  branches: ["main", { name: "alpha", prerelease: true }],
  exec: {
    prepareCmd: "...",
    publishCmd: "...",
  },
});
```
